A Quiz Game Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I designed a small quiz game with 10 questions using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Every time when we open the quiz, the 10 questions are displayed in random order.

Languages Used:

    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
  
Hyper Text Markup Language:
  
    - HTML gives structure and layout for the quiz game.
    - Elements used are:
           - div tags
           - radio buttons
           - buttons
           - paragraph and heading tags
         
         
Cascading Style Sheets:

     - CSS is used for the presentation of the game.
     - I used selectors like "class" and "id". Mostly class.
     - Framework
          - Bootstrap is a free and open source CSS framework. It contains design templates for buttons, paragraphs, forms etc..
          - Link for bootstrap:  https://getbootstrap.com/
     - Google Fonts for the font styles and family.
     - Fonts used are:
          - Itim
          - Yeon Sung
          - Yusei Magic
          - Dekko
          - Harmattan
          - Nova Oval


JavaScript:

     - JavaScript gives the functionality for the game.
     - It also increases the interactivity between the user and browser.
     - Used some in-built functions to select the elements and some user-defined functions for the functionality of the game.
